# Troubleshooting the Azure File Share Microsoft Graph connector  

###  Common errors observed while configuring the connector

| Configuration step | Error message | Possible reason |
|:----|:----|:----|
| Authentication | There are errors with file paths or URLs. `The Graph connector agent associated with the connection is not reachable.` | Check if the agent is running or if the app credentials have expired or been revoked. Refer to [Graph connector agent troubleshooting](./graph-connector-agent.md#troubleshooting)  |
| Authentication | There are errors with file paths or URLs. `No files were found in the path provided. The client doesn't have permission to perform the action.` | Check if the path is correct and the account provided has access to the files. |
| Authentication | There are errors with file paths or URLs. `The user account provided does not have permissions for the files in this location.`  | Check if the client does have permission to perform the action, if the path is correct and the account provided has access to the files. |
| Authentication | There are errors with file paths or URLs. `Incorrect username or password.` | Check the authentication details with the data source. The username or password is incorrect, if the credentials are not correct, we don't check the file path access. |
| Crawling | There are errors with file paths or URLs. `You don't have permission to access this data source. You can contact the owner of this data source to request permission. â€œPreserve Last Access" is enabled for the connection which requires "write" permissions on the file to update the access time.` | Check if "write" permissions are provided to the file/root directory. This occurs when provided credentials do not have 'Write' permission needed to preserve file's last access time. |
