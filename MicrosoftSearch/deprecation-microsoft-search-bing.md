# Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization

Starting March 31, 2025, work search through Bing.com is being retired. This change is being made as Microsoft streamlines search experiences to focus on enhancing core productivity tools.

While Microsoft Search is being removed from Bing, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through Microsoft365.com, Office.com, and SharePoint Online. Users can also still find people in their organization, files, and SharePoint sites using the Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box.

## What is being retired?

Bing.com will no longer show work search results. Work-related answers will no longer appear among web search results on Bing.com and there will no longer be a dedicated page for work results (the “Work” tab). Search boxes that IT admins configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work results. People who have bookmarks for www.bing.com/work will be redirected to Microsoft365.com through June 30, 2025.

## When and where will these changes take place? 

Microsoft Search in Bing is being retired in all regions worldwide on March 31, 2025. It is being retired on all devices, including mobile. 

## Where can users search for work answers? 

Microsoft365.com, Office.com, and SharePoint Online are the new homes for Microsoft Search. The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will also continue to deliver work search results with some adjustments, detailed here: 

## Edge address bar 

The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar will no longer send users to a Bing.com page for work-related search results. Instead, the Edge address bar will display work results on Office.com. Users of the address bar can also continue to find work-related documents and bookmarks in suggested results. 

## Windows search box 

The Windows search box is removing the "Work" tab, but will continue to support work search. Searches will deliver work results only for documents initially, with more content types returned as quickly as possible. With these changes, UX changes are also coming to the Windows search box.

## Is enterprise branding on Bing.com being removed?

Yes. Bing will no longer display any organizational branding. Likewise, new tab pages in Edge will no longer display any custom branding.

## What actions are required for customers? 

- Prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025.
- Transition to using Microsoft Search through the Microsoft Edge for Business address bar, the Windows search box, or through Microsoft365.com, Office.com, or SharePoint Online. Customers can add these entry points to favorites or the favorites bar in Edge for Business as a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for Business for their organization—[see details here](/deployedge/edge-learnmore-provision-favorites).
- Inform your users as soon as possible about the upcoming changes and the alternatives available.
- Consider retiring Microsoft Search in Bing before March 31, 2025 for your organization. If you choose to do so, you can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to Settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center > Settings > Search & Intelligence.

## Why is this announcement important?  

Searching for files, people, intranet sites, and more is an important part of daily productivity. We understand that the retirement of Microsoft Search in Bing may create some disruption in daily work, so we're ensuring that customers are aware of this change before it happens. Just as importantly, we want users to know that they have other options for accessing Microsoft Search. They can also continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box to find work results, with some adjustments.

## Why is this happening?

Customer productivity is our mission and making work search a better experience remains a priority for Microsoft. We hope to better serve you through Microsoft Search in the core productivity experiences of Microsoft365.com, Office.com, and SharePoint Online. We’re also continuing to explore new ways to improve the experience and make work search more discoverable.

## Will there be any impact on users prior to March 31, 2025? 

Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the deprecation experience, a small set of users may find before that date that Bing isn't available as an endpoint for work search. We recommend that you inform your users of the change and direct them to Microsoft365.com, Office.com, and SharePoint Online instead. Adding these entry points to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway.

## Can customers try to opt out of this change? 

No, customers cannot opt out of the change, but customers may opt to set their own date for the change. Admins who wish to retire Microsoft Search in Bing before March 31, 2025, can turn it off by going to Settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center: Settings > Search & Intelligence. 

## What will happen to bookmarks? 

Editorial bookmarks (bookmarks that an IT admin has curated) will continue to work on the other Microsoft Search entry points (Microsoft365.com, Office.com, SharePoint Online, and the Edge for Business address bar).  

Today, Microsoft Search also recommends bookmarks based on your organization's SharePoint links. After March 31, Microsoft Search will no longer recommend bookmarks.  

Some organizations have set their recommended bookmarks to automatically publish. Automatically published bookmarks, which currently only appear in Microsoft Search in Bing, will no longer be visible after March 31. If your organization automatically publishes recommended bookmarks, and you'd like those bookmarks to be visible on other Microsoft Search entry points, you must publish them before April 30, 2025. You can also export your recommended bookmarks by April 30 if you want to keep them, but don't want to publish them.

## Does this impact all tenants? 

Yes, all tenants who have had access to Microsoft Search in Bing are affected.
