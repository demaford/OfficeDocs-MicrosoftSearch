### Unique users and weekly returning users

The chart below displays two key metrics: the number of unique users who queried for the connector at least once in the past 30 days and the return rate for those users over the last 7 days. This data can help you assess user engagement and retention patterns during this recent period.

### Connection specific usage

This report shows the details (Connection name, total items indexed, total impressions, unique users and click through rate) for all the connections that have been created. It shows the number of items indexed and how many times users are seeing that connector content. It also tells the number of unique users, which indicates whether your audience is expanding over time, and if the content is even useful to them by click-through rate.

## Download reports

Each report and table have a download option that allows you to download the background data for the report that you see on the screen in an Excel format. Where the displayed report is limited to the top five to ten rows, the downloaded report has up to 2000 top records.

Downloading a report allows you to see reports from a broader range of time. The report is downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet based on the selected date filter. If you chose the past 28 days, the spreadsheet would have an individual tab for each day. The past 12 months download has a tab for each month.

## Prevent filtering by country, occupation, department, or division

By default, users with search administrator and search editor roles can filter search data by country, occupation, or department/division. If you don't want administrators to filter your report data using these dimensions, you can go into your organizational settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and configure this setting.  When this setting is unchecked, administrators won't be able to filter the **Connection analytics details** reports by these filters.  

Only global administrators can configure this setting.

To configure this setting:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings**, then select **Org Settings**.
2. On the Org Setting page, select **Search & intelligence usage analytics**.
3. On the Search & intelligence usage analytics page, uncheck **Allow usage reports to be filtered by country, occupation, department, or division**.
4. Select **Save**.
