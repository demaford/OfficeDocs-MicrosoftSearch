# CSV Microsoft Graph connector

The CSV Microsoft Graph connector allows your organization to ingest content from CSV files stored in SharePoint libraries and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). After you configure the connector and index content from these sources, end users can find CSV files in Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

This article is for anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a CSV Microsoft Graph connector. It supplements the general setup process and shows instructions that apply only to this connector.

## Capabilities

- Retain ACLs defined by your organization
- Customize your crawl frequency
- Create agents and workflows using this connection and plugins from Microsoft Copilot Studio

## Limitations

- Profile enrichment scenarios aren't supported at this time
- Spaces in CSV column headers are not supported

<!---## Before you get started-->
## Prerequisites

- Make sure there's no whitespace in the CSV headers

- For a SharePoint data source, you can authenticate using either of the two OAuth providers: **Microsoft Entra ID** (coming soon) or **SharePoint provider** ([retiring soon](/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/retirement-announcement-for-azure-acs)).
    - For authenticating using Microsoft Entra ID you'll need to create and register an app on Microsoft Entra ID.
    - For authenticating using SharePoint provider you'll need to create a SharePoint app with OAuth configuration.

> [!TIP]
> You will be able to switch the OAuth provider for your published connection from SharePoint to Microsoft Entra ID, once available

- For an ADLS data source, you'll need to create an ADLS storage account.

## SharePoint data source

### Upload your CSV files

Verify the .csv files you want to index have been uploaded to a SharePoint document library. You can use an existing SharePoint site or create a new one.

### Create an app on Microsoft Entra ID

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with admin credentials for the tenant.

2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** -> **Manage** -> **App registrations** from the navigation pane and select **New registration**.

3. Provide a name for the app and select **Register**.

4. Make a note of the application (client) ID.

5. Open **API permissions** from the navigation pane and select **Add a permission**.

6. Select **SharePoint** and then **Delegated permissions**.

7. Search for the following permissions and select **Add permissions**. <br>
    a. AllSites.Read<br>
    b. User.Read.All

8. Select **Grant admin consent for [TenantName]** and confirm by selecting **Yes**.

9. Check that the permissions are in the "**granted**" state.

10. Open **Authentication** from the navigation pane and select **Add a platform**. Select **Web** under **Web applications** and add the following under Redirect URIs (Authorization callback URIs):
    - For **M365 Enterprise**: `https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback`
    - For **M365 Government**: `https://gcsgcc.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback`

#### Configuring the client secret for authentication

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with admin credentials for the tenant.

2. Open **App Registration** from the navigation pane and go to the appropriate App. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates and Secrets**.

3. Select **New Client Secret** and select an expiry period for the secret. Copy the generated secret and save it because it is not shown again.

4. Use this Client secret and the application ID to configure the connector.

### Create a SharePoint app with OAuth configuration (retiring soon)

1. Go to  `https://Org-Name.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`.
2. On the Client ID and Client Secret fields, select **Generate**.
3. For Title, enter an app name.
4. In the App Domain field, enter `www.gcs.com`.
5. In the Redirect URL field, enter `https://www.gcs.com`.
6. Select **Create**.
7. Copy the app configuration information, including the Client ID and Client Secret. You'll need it when you set up the CSV connector.

#### Enable app permissions to allow customAppAuthentication

In PowerShell ([SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online)), run these commands in administrative mode. Use the email address of the admin configuring the connector and your organization name. When the password pop-up appears, the admin should enter their password.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell
$adminUPN=”<admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com>”
$orgName=“<contoso>”
$userCredential = Get-Credential -UserName $adminUPN -Message "Enter your password."
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $userCredential
Set-spotenant –DisableCustomAppAuthentication $false
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using PowerShell 7, use this command first `Import-Module microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell -UseWindowsPowerShell`

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using multifactor authentication, use `Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com`.

#### Complete the app configuration

1. Go to `https://Org-Name.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`.
2. In the App ID field, paste the client ID of the SharePoint app and select **Lookup**.
3. In the permission Request XML field, paste this code and select **Create**.

```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
    <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web" Right="Read" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```

4. Select **Trust it**.

## ADLS data source

### Create an ADLS storage account

For step-by-step guidance, see [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create#create-a-storage-account-1). To allow file storage capabilities, on the Advanced tab, select **Enable hierarchical namespace** and **Create a container for this site**.

When you set up the CSV Microsoft Graph connector, you'll need to provide a primary storage connection string. To find it, open the storage account you created and select **Access keys**. Select **Show keys** and copy the connection string for Key1.

## Step 1: Add a Microsoft Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center

[Add CSV Microsoft Graph connector](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/MicrosoftSearch/Connectors/add?ms_search_referrer=MicrosoftSearchDocs_CSV&type=CSV)
