# Troubleshooting guide for Salesforce Microsoft Graph connector 

### 1. **Bad state error while signing-in to create a connection**

The PKCE option is checked in the application, causing the issue. To fix it, uncheck this option in the app registration in Salesforce.

### 2. **OAuth app scope names have changed**
The name of the selected OAuth scopes changed to the following names: 

- Access and manage your data (API) is now = **Manage user data via APIs (api)**

- Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access) is now = **Perform requests at any time**

### 3. **Insufficient permissions**
Review the setup of the configured user profile. The `View Setup and Configuration` must be checked and the API must be enabled for `Org` and `Profile`.

Under **Administrative Permissions**, ensure `View Roles and Role Hierarchy`, `View All Profiles`, and`View All Users` permissions are in place. Under **Standard Object Permissions**, ensure `Read` and `View All` permissions to the following objects: Accounts, Cases, Contacts, Leads and Opportunities.

### 3. **Unable to search for items from a field**
If you're not seeing any results from a particular field in Salesforce, ensure that the field is being indexed by the connector and does not have Field-Level Security enabled.

You can check if the field is being indexed by the connector from the **Manage Properties** section of the **Content** tab.
You can check the Field-Level Security settings in Salesforce from Setup > Object manager > Select Object > Fields & Relationships > Select Field name > View Field Accessibility.

To get more information on the types of errors, go to the **error details** page after selecting the connection. Select the **error code** to see more detailed errors. Also refer to [Monitor your connections](./manage-connector.md) to learn more.
